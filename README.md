# animation-art-keele
Part of coursework assignment for Computer Animation and Multimedia module at Keele University, spring semester 2022.

## What's it about
A Processing sketch inspired by an artist or artwork: Campbell's Soup Cans by Andy Warhol, 1962.

### Goals to meet assessment criteria
- The sketch should use graphical primitives and implement a simple animation effect.  
- A label should identify the artist or artwork that inspired the sketch.
- If interaction is needed to activate the animation, this should be displayed on screen.
- Header, comments, code format, on-screen labels or user instructions also assessed

### Used technologies
Processing (Java)

### Timeline
Completed in March 2023. Did not think to use git at the time, hence only the code of the final product is available.
